# Getting Started with Spark Icons

Spark makes it possible for you to include SVG
icons right into your project using two basic
methods, **Compile Time** and **Run Time**. 

For more information on working with SVG icons, check out
[this guide](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/).

## Compile Time

The first method includes building SVG icons right
into your site at compile time. This method involves
downloading the latest SVG, from the correct CDN URL,
as part of your build process. That way, you’ll be
able to embed the SVG directly into your compiled site.

### Pros:
- The main advantages of this method are performance
and reliability. The user avoids waiting for the CDN
to serve the SVG, making this method ideal for production
environments where load times are critical.
- Gives development teams more control over which SVGs
are included in the site. Since the SVG file is downloaded
during development, developers can review the SVG file
before publishing and include only the versions they’ve tested.

### Cons:
- However, this method does require more development work
at the beginning for building and maintaining the connection
to the CDN over the long term.

You can find additional examples by using these helpful 
[Gulp](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/blob/master/gulpfile.js#L11)
and
[Gatsby](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-design-system/blob/staging/plugins/gatsby-symbol-set-fetch/gatsby-node.js)
files.

>***Note***: If you use this method you must not put
the SVG file in your source control repository.
The SVG file should only be hosted on the official CDN.

## Run Time

The second method includes dynamically loading the SVG
icons at run time. This method involves adding the full SVG
and entire icon set, as a separate HTTP request, while the
page loads using an
[AJAX request](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-design-system/blob/staging/storybook-utilities/icon-utilities/icon-loader.js).
That way, the full SVG and
icons are automatically embedded at the top of your page making
them available to use within the body.

### Pros:
- The primary advantage of this method is that the least amount of
setup and additional tooling needed. It’s ideal for quick,
non-production projects.

### Cons:
- This method mainly lacks performance. You can easily end up
downloading the icons more than once on subsequent page loads
and having to wait for multiple downloads to complete.
- Icons are not visible while you’re still waiting for the
download to complete separate from the main site download.
- If the SVG file within the CDN changes, you’ll see the
update immediately without a chance for review.

You can find additional examples by using these environment
[Angular](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-angular/blob/kitchen-sink/src/app/spark-docs/icon-set/icon-set.component.ts)
and [React](https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-react/blob/kitchen-sink/src/components/IconSet/IconSet.js) 
component files.

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure the icon SVG is included at the top of your page,
directly after the `<body>` element.
- To use your own icon set with the Spark components, your
icons must have the exact same names as the icons listed
[here](/using-spark/components/icon).
