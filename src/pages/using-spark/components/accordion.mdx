# Accordion

Accordion expands and collapses multiple
sections of related content.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="accordion--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Accordion is used when you have lower-priority
content that needs to be broken up into digestible chunks.

### Guidelines

- By default, all section of an Accordion are
collapsed, so high-priority content should be avoided.
- Avoid complex interactions in Accordion.
Things like forms, buttons, dropdowns, and nested
Accordions weaken usability.
- Keep Accordion titles short so the text
stays on one line.
- Accordion titles should be relevant to the content
inside so the user can quickly decide if opening
it will provide the information they need.
- The width of the Accordion should be
controlled by the layout of the page.
- Expand/collapse is indicated by a chevron Icon,
but the entire header area is clickable for the same action.
- If your instance only has one item, consider using the [Toggle Component](https://sparkdesignsystem.com/using-spark/components/toggle) instead.

<SprkDivider
