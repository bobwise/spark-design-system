# Tooltip

The Tooltip component appears as a popup design providing
a short text description of information about a feature when the user hovers over the item.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="tooltip--default-story"
  minHeight="10rem"
  hasHTML
  hasAngular
  hasReact
/>

### Usage

Use Tooltip when the feature needs to be explained in
further detail to walk users through a specific action.
It helps to draw the users' attention to a feature without
interrupting their workflow. They can currently only be used on icons.
They can be used on icons next to any feature such as icon buttons, inputs or tables.

- Appears when a user hovers or focuses on the Tooltip icon.
- Remains visible if the user hovers off of the icon onto the Tooltip.
- Can be toggled open by clicking or tapping on the Tooltip icon or with the Enter or Space keys.
- Remains in view until the component is no longer hovered or focused.
- Can be dismissed with the Escape key on the keyboard.

### Guidelines

- Information should be discrete, short and concise.
- Do not use as a warning or alert.
- Do not include links or launch modals from a Tooltip.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- Content within Tooltips must be text-based with a maximum character count of 140.
- The maximum width of Tooltips must be 290px.
- Text should be wrapped when the content is wider than the max width.
- The position of the design changes based on how close the feature is to the screen's edge such as:

<img
  class="sprk-u-mbm"
  src={tooltipExample}
  alt="The Spark Tooltip component depicted in four different orientations."/>

## Accessibility
Tooltips are discoverable and 
[operable](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#operable) 
by users that rely on a diverse set of established navigational means. Also, in compliance with 
[1.4.13: Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html) 
WCAG rules, we make sure that any content appearing on hover or focus is dismissible and persistent.

- Must be accessible by mouse, pointer devices, keyboard-only, screen reader, zoom software and any other assistive technology.
- Allow the mouse to easily move over the Tooltip without dismissing it. 
- Complex content should be browsable line by line using screen readers. 
- Always include a visible label within UI controls.
- Interactive elements must be reachable using keyboard. 
- Tooltips use `aria-describedby` and `id` to establish a relationship between the trigger and content for screen readers and other assistive technology.
- Tooltips use `aria-hidden` so they are unreachable by screen readers when the Tooltip is not expanded.
- Add text alternatives to icon buttons to express action user is taking.
