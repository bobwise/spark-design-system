# Button

A Button represents an action or choice for the user.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Buttons are the main actionable items on a page.
Buttons typically trigger a new UI element to appear
on the page and are essential to submitting forms,
beginning a new task, or navigating to the next
step in a process.

When designing actions, Button variants imply hierarchy.
Use Primary Buttons first, then use Secondary,
Tertiary and Quaternary variants for other
actions accordingly.

### Guidelines

- Effective Button text uses precise, task-specific
action verbs like: “Add”, “Remove”, “Read Details”,
and “Submit”. Avoid ambiguous words like “Yes”,
“No”, “OK”, and “Click Here”.
- Effective Button text is less than 20 characters.
- All button text should be in title case
(capitalize the first letter of each word).
- Button text should never wrap to a second line.
- Button width should not exceed 280px.
- For navigational actions that appear within
a line of text, use [Link](/using-spark/components/link)
instead of Button.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Primary Button

Use for the most important action, with no more than two primary buttons per page. Use other button types and visually create a digestible content flow and hierarchy.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Secondary Button

Typically represents the second highest priority, following the Primary Button. There can be more than one on a page and can depict similar or different actions.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--secondary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Tertiary Button

Can be paired with Primary and Secondary Buttons, and often represents the third priority on the page.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--tertiary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Quaternary Button

Use for the sign in buttons in the top navigation, or sometimes on a page for the least important actions.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--quaternary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## States

### Disabled

Represents an action that’s not currently available to the user. A disabled button implies that the Button would be available given a certain set of circumstances. Since a user can’t interact with this Button, consider if it’s necessary to show the Disabled Button at all.

#### Disabled - Primary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

#### Disabled - Secondary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled-secondary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

#### Disabled - Tertiary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled-tertiary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Spinning

When data is being saved or submitted, a spinning
indicator may replace the Button text.

#### Spinning - Primary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

#### Spinning - Secondary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning-secondary"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
/>

#### Spinning - Tertiary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning-tertiary"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
/>


### Full Width at Smaller Viewports

At small viewport sizes, a Button may be used at full width.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--full-width-at-small-viewport"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Anatomy

- A Button must contain text and/or an Icon

## Accessibility

- If a Button only includes an Icon with no
text, alternative text must be provided.
