# Tabs

The Tabs component organizes multiple sections of
related content so a client can view one section at a time. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="tabs--default-story"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Tabs are used to navigate between multiple sections
of related content without leaving the context of the page. 

### Guidelines

- There needs to be at least two Tabs buttons, but not more than seven.
- The text of each Tabs button cannot be on two lines so must be kept short.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- Tabs must contain Tabs buttons.
- Each Tabs button must be connected to a content panel.

## Accessibility

- Clients can navigate through the Tabs
with LEFT/RIGHT and UP/DOWN arrow keys.
- Clients can jump to the first Tabs button
with HOME and to the last Tabs button with END.
- The associated content panel is activated automatically
when a client navigates to a new Tabs button.
- The TAB key moves the client into the content
associated with the Tabs button and SHIFT+TAB
moves focus back to the button.
